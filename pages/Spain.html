				<h1>Back in Spain</h1>
				<p>I tried to include all my exchange year in this website, but it seemed a bit impossible to write about the whole year, so I wrote about the most important topics and the ones, that in my opinion, were most interesting.</p>

				<p>
A lot of people have already asked me if this exchange year in the United States was worth the money and why did I do it during my 11th grade, which is “Primero de Bachillerato” in Spain. I calculated the price of the program added with all my expenses during the year, it was more than 12000 euros. Clearly, most people cannot afford this experience in a foreign country for a year, same happened to me at first because I could not afford this either. How did I make it possible? I sacrificed all my weekends and holidays working at a restaurant to earn money, so I can add it with the savings that my parents gave me to make this possible. I do not regret spending this much money because I think all the friendships that I made and all the knowledge and life values that I received from other people are priceless. In my opinion, if you actually want to go study abroad, but you think that you cannot afford it, I must tell you that nothing is impossible and there will be always ways to make it happen. It might also seem more reasonable to do this during university, because after a year in a foreign country I could have the possibility of forgetting Catalan or Spanish and I would not be able to keep up with my classes when I came back, but I said to myself that I really wanted to do it no matter what others say. Also, if I improve my English, it would not be hard to pass other English tests to study abroad in the future. Now that I am back, I am not having issues with my classes. If you are doubting about your English, do not worry about it, if your goal is to improve your English, you just have to be surrounded by the language and use it more, certainly, you will speak it fluently.

<p>In addition, as I was progressing with this project with the interviews, I realized how exchange students’ roles are important to some many people’s lives. Exchange students do not only provide the culture of a country, but also help people see things from other perspectives.</p>
