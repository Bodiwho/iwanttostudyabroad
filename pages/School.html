				<h1>High School</h1>
				<p>Before higher education or the best-called college or university, American students attend primary and secondary school for a combined total of 12 years. These years are called the twelfth grades.The children around the age of six begin primary school, or also called as the “elementary school.” The elementary school consists of a period of five to six years. After they finish primary school, they begin secondary school, which is separated into two programs: the first program referred to as “middle school” or “junior school” and the second program is “high school.” High school consists of the last four years of secondary school, which can be known in Spain as the two last years of “ESO” combined with the two years of “Bachillerato”. When students graduate from high school (12th grade), nearly all the U.S. students go on to college or university and others may go to work directly. The majority of schools begin in August or September depending on the states they are located and end around May or June. The school year at almost all of the schools is composed of two terms referred to as “semesters.” Yet other schools divide the year into the system of four terms, or even into eight terms.</p>

				<p>
				I attended Explore Academy, charter school. A charter school is a publicly funded independent school established by teachers, parents, or community groups under the terms of a charter with a local or national authority. It educates pupils from grades 6 to 12. The school year is divided is not divided into semesters of year-long courses. Students in grades 6-7 attend four 44- day terms and students in grades 8-12 attend eight 22-day terms.
				In every term, students take five classes with each focusing on a specific set of standards for students to master. The day is divided into seven different periods and two of them are free periods, also called flex periods, for students to do homework, have lunch, receive tutoring, etc. During the last two days of each term, students take final exams to demonstrate proficiency in all standards from each seminar during that term.
				Also, between terms, there is a one- or two-day term break in which there is no school, and this lets the teachers and students grade exit exams and prepare for the start of the next term.</p>

				<p>
				Explore believes that student success is due to individual attention, so all class sizes are kept small, with an average class size of about 14, this allows the teachers to focus on each student as an individual learner with specific needs and characteristics. As the classes are small, no student is lost in the crowded and every student’s path is valued and monitored as they progress through the school year. Additionally, the school director once said on a Monday meeting that his purpose of keeping the classes small is also to make the school feel like a family to the student. On Fridays, there is a period dedicated to clubs which students choose from a list of different clubs to participate in.</p>
				<p>
				At Explore Academy, there are sports teams in which students can participate and compete between different high schools.The school also has public bus transport that covers most of the city of Albuquerque so the students can get to the school.</p>
				<p>The exchange students not only had to behave correctly at their host house but also at their high school. At the school where I went to for the year, Explore Academy, it was extremely serious with the behavior and the academic results of the students. As I mentioned in the ETC policy rules, if the students do not pass the classes for a long period, the students may be sent back to their home country.</p>
