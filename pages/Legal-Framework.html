				<h1>LEGAL FRAMEWORK</h1>

			<p>Firstly, I found an organization that awarded scholarships to students based on their academic results. The name of this organization is <a href="https://ieduex.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #88D5F7; ">iEduex</a>. I called them to talk about what I wanted to do, and they told me that everything was good for me. The next thing I did was to make an appointment to do the ElTis test to show my English level. ELTis is a standardized English test that measures a person’s English level. It is the language test that all students have to take to participate in exchange programs in public schools in the US. The ELTis test was included in the price in advance. The test includes a reading which lasts 25 minutes and listening which lasts 45 minutes. I did the exam on a website where I entered a code that iEduex had given to me so they can receive the results instantly. There was a timer on a corner of the webpage so I could keep track of the time I had left. I passed the test with the highest proficiency level, and they told me that I would just have to wait for them to contact me again. If you do not pass the test, you would just have to repeat it on another day.
			
			<p>A few days later, iEduex told me that I got chosen by the sponsor called ETC. ETC is a non-profit organization with the purpose of promoting international understanding and the exchange of cultural programs in the United States and abroad. They were the organization that  placed me into an American family, iEduex was just an intermediary between ETC and me. At first, I thought that this is absurd because I could have contacted ETC and apply for the exchange program, but now that I think it was worth the money to iEduex because they were the ones always in charge to help me do all the documents I needed to apply for.</p>
			<p>
			iEduex had told me that ETC had created an online application form for me to fill in it. The application was divided into different sections, from personal interests and hobbies to medical statements. One of them was to write a letter to my future “host family”. As I said at the beginning, families were free to choose which exchange student matched the profile of their family. Then in this letter, I had to explain more about myself and why I wanted to go to study in the US so a family that liked my profile would like to host me.
			One of the most important requirements for the program is to complete a medical document in which they [the company hosting the program] asked you for your vaccination history and a tuberculosis test. I had all my vaccines done but I had some problems with the tuberculosis test. I went to the outpatient’s clinic and did the test, it came negative but the doctors did not want to sign the documents that ETC had given me. In the end, I contacted iEduex and told them about the issue I was having with my medical document. They said that I should not worry about it because they will solve it. They gave me 30 days to fill in the form, but I did it in 40.
		<h2 class="subti">Documents Required</h2>

		<p>One of the sections in the application was to fill in four tables with my final grades gotten at my school for the past four years. Since I did not keep all my final transcripts of each year, I had to ask my school council to give them to me stamped by the school. Also, I had my tutor and my
		English teacher, Begoña fill some documents out which were about my academic progress and my English level.</p>

		<p>Now that I had the application form filled in, I needed to get my J1 VISA and the DS 2019 form, two documents that have to be together with me during the entry of the country. Firstly, as Wikipedia says about J-1 Visa: “J-1 Visa is a non-immigrant visa issued by the United States to scholars, professors and exchange visitors participating in programs that promote cultural exchange. All applicants must meet eligibility criteria, English language requirements, and be sponsored by a university, private sector or government program”. Secondly, the form DS-2019 "is the basic document required to support an application for an exchange visitor visa. It is a 2-page document. Foreign nationals are required to sign page one of the form agreeing to the instructions and certification language relating to participation in the exchange program found on page two". These two documents were the only ones that I needed to step into the American country legally. As I mentioned previously, iEduex was in charge to apply these documents for me so I just needed to go to the embassy for the interview and leave my passport there so they could put the VISA on it and afterwards, I would receive it by mail.</p>

		<p>The embassy of the United States is in Madrid, so I had to go there on my interview day and the orientation program that iEduex organized. iEduex organized this event so they could prepare us and teach us everything we needed to know before our departure. I went to the embassy with my passport and my form DS-2019. At the entrance, they told me that I needed four photos of me, so I took them on the machine at the embassy. After getting the pictures done, I went directly to one of the windows where a woman asked for the documents to me. I handed them and she asked me how long I would stay in the US, then I replied for one year. They kept my passport and told me that I would get it back in three weekdays.</p>

		<p>My parents did not get involved in this process except for signing the papers that I asked them to because firstly they did not have time for this and secondly because I did not want to bother them with this. They had to sign the documents agreeing with me to be in this program, other documents accepting that I would have to follow all the rules that ETC set and, if I did break any of them, I would be sent back home. There were some letters that my parents had to write to my future host family but as my parents do not understand English, I wrote the letter for them translating their ideas. They signed another document when I received my placement in New Mexico, it was the authorization to have another exchange student at my host family. Additionally, while I was in the United States my parents also had to sign other documents of agreeing me going to trips that were longer than two days.</p>
