				<h1>My Own Experience</h1>

			<p>After I had my passport back with my VISA, the only thing I had to do was to wait until I was chosen by a host family. At the end of June, I received a call from iEduex telling me that a gay family in Austin, Texas, was interested in me. They asked me if I would agree to live in a gay family and I said yes because I did not care about how was the family either the state, I only wanted to live in a family who wanted to host me. After a few days, iEduex told me that the gay family did not choose at the end, so I still had to wait.
			</p>
			<p>
			The process was finally finished, and I only had to purchase my flight tickets to Albuquerque.
To know the family a bit better I read the host familyâ€™s application and I found out that the family had tons of different types of animals, such as dogs, cats, goats, chickens, and even a pig! The family has already hosted more than ten exchange students over the world for the past ten years and my host dad worked as a sales associate at Ferguson and my host mom worked for ETC as Field Manager, the person who places the exchange students in host families and organizes events for students. I had two host brothers, who were 7 and 13, and a host sister who was 5. Later on, I found out that the person who wanted to place me into the family in Texas was my 
			host mom, and in the end, she decided to host me.
		</p>

	height:37vh;"></div>
		<p>
After giving me the information about the host family, they also sent me the information about my local coordinator, whom I could talk to if I had any problems with my family or school issues. The first contact I had with my host family was with my host dad. I asked a few questions about the family and when it was the best time to get there. They told me that school started on the 13 August, so I needed to arrive before that. My flight was on 9 August, but casually it was the day before my father and my sister returned from China. I could not say goodbye to them before I left for my one-year adventure.
</p>
<p>As the student has a list of rules while he is in the US, the family also had to follow rules to host the family. My family did not show me all the rules and chores on my first day of staying, they taught me every single thing throughout the year. The first rule they showed to Matheus and me was that the phones were not allowed on the dinner table. The next thing they taught us was our only chore, cleaning the dishes. Another very important thing in the family was to spend more time with the host family. We were not allowed to stay in our bedroom for the whole day that was not what they asked for and spending time with them was the main reason they chose me, to spend time with me and at the same time exchange our cultures to each other. They told us that our curfew was at 9 pm on school nights and 11 pm on no school nights. Even our host parents did not take our phones away from us, indeed, we could not be on our electronics for too long.</p>

	height:35vh;"></div>
	<h2 class="subti">Local Coordinator</h2>

	<p>Every exchange student has a coordinator whom we could talk about the issues we were having with our families or school. We had to meet with our coordinators every month so they know how we were doing at school and in the family and also to inform us about the events that were going to take place during that month. My coordinator was Paula Pond and she has been helping Matheus and I to improve our English and our relationship with the family. We also had to send our grades monthly so they could have a track on our progress.</p>

	.<div class="lista">
	<ul>
		<li>Changing our technologic devices language to English.</li><li>Watching shows or series in English.</li><li>Not to talk to my friends and family in Spain very often.</li><li>Spending more time with the host family.</li><li>Making more American friends.</li><li>Stop using other languages with other exchange students.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>After using the tips she gave me, My speaking and the listening of English in barely two months. I could understand everything that my teachers said and the meaning of long texts, although I still had to improve my writing.</p>

	<h2 class="subti">Friendships</h2>
	<p>Friendship really mattered during my exchange program. It did not only bring me happiness and joy but it also gave me opportunities of meeting people from other parts of the world. The first bunch of friends I made were exchange students just like me that my host mom introduced to Matheus and I because she wanted us and I to practice our English. The friendships that I made with the exchange students were more different than the ones I made with American people because I felt empathy with them, they came from another country and also had to face some of the same problems as me. Now that we are all back in our home countries, I had an opportunity to visit some exchange students in Germany when I went to Berlin.

	<h2 class="subti">Trips</h2>
	<p>During my stay in the city of Albuquerque, I have also been to some other places other than Albuquerque. The first trip that I made with my host family was to a town named Pecos situated in a mountain where we had a cabin. During the school year, we have been there for more than three times and every time we went there, we always spent a few days to enjoy the wilderness. It is true that sometimes Matheus and I did not want to go because there is no internet connection at Pecos, but we never regretted after we went there because we always liked the feeling of being disconnected from the electronics and getting closer to nature.
	</p>
	<p>
The next place after I have been was the state of Colorado. The purpose of going there was to see our host-grandparents, they have lived there for years and also have a cabin in the woods. Even though I had to follow the rule of not driving motor vehicles, I broke it while I was there but nobody would know it if nobody says about it. I drove a four-wheeler with my host-brothers and we crashed. Good that nothing serious happened.</p>
		<div class="orien"><img src="../images/IMG_1167.JPG" style="width: 37vw;
	height:40vh;"></div>
	<p>ETC also organized trips for exchange students to the most popular cities in the US, for example: New York, Hawaii, San Francisco and Los Angeles. At first, I thought that I was not going to any of them because they were a bit expensive, but after finding out that the Los Angeles
trip did not have that many people, ETC sent an email saying that if we refer a person to go on this trip, we will get $50. I referred to people and that made my trip more inexpensive. The LA trip was four-day trip which I went with some of my exchange student friends. We had to follow an itinerary closely because we did not have enough time to visit all the places in LA. The places that we visited were: the Santa Monica Pier, the Walk of Fame, Disneyland and Universal Studios.</p>

	<div class="orien"><img src="../images/IMG_8116.jpg" style="width: 36vw;
	height:44vh;"></div>
	<p>Lastly and the most important. Even in the picture (Figure 15) we all looked happy, this picture almost sent my friends and I back home. As I said in the trip section, while I was in Los Angeles, my friend and I went to a place which was 25 kilometers away. At first, we planned not to tell anybody this nor posting anything about this, but a friend did post a picture of being in Beverly Hills not realizing what the consequences of that could cause. A few days we went home, the school front desk officer told me to go to the school office because someone was looking for me. When I entered the room, there was the coordinator who was with me during the LA trip, I did not understand the situation because I also saw the friends which went to Beverly Hills with me. The coordinator started to talk and explain the trouble that we were in. She told us that they found out that we went 25 kilometers away from the hotel and the consequences for doing that. She said that she was going to contact our host-parents and we also had to write an apology letter to the guides who accompanied us in LA. The very first consequence was the suspension of going to more trips with ETC which did not affect me because I did not want to go to the other trips. The next consequence was the loss of trust from my host-parents. They were told to not letting Matheus and I go hang out with our friends anymore during the first two weeks. iEduex also called me to tell me that I had to be careful with all my actions during the rest of the year. A week after, another ETC assistant came to our house to tell us that we were in final probation8, which means that any little breaking of rules would make us be sent back home.</p>

	<h2 class="subti">Interview Analysis</h2>

	<p>Additionaly, I also made interviews to American people who have met exchange students to see if they are happy about it, and what is enriching for them.
The interviews were done using Google forms and all the questions were open questions except two. I left the other questions open so the people who responded to the survey had to write their answers. I asked 7 questions and the first three ones were about their roles with the exchange students, their opinions about hosting one and if they have not yet, if they would like to host one if they could. The last four questions were about what they have learned from the experience of hosting exchange students and how they changed their lives. Also, I asked a question about if an exchange opportunity was given to them if they would like to study abroad for 10 months. I decided to include these questions in my survey because the responses will show how they actually feel about the exchange students and also putting them in the shoes of the exchange students. Their open responses would also be useful to cite them as evidence.
